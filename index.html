                        </ul>
                            <ol>
                                <li>First make sure all of your gear fits properly and is on correctly.</li>
                                <li>Get on the bike and raise the kickstand if one is installed on your bike.</li>
                                <li>Check to be sure you are in neutral.</li>
                            <ul><li>This can be accomplished by pushing down on she shifter a few times, then up once.</li></ul>
                                <li>Push down firmly on the starter while having a firm grasp on the clutch and applying a little gas. Not a lot, an eighth turn should suffice. Make sure your left foot is on the peg and your right is firmly planted on the ground.</li>
                                <li>The bike should be started and you should be sitting in neutral. Now let your hand on the throttle relax, but keep it on the bar. To put the bike into first gear keep a grip on the clutch push down on the shifter once.</li>
                                <li>To start riding slowly release the clutch and the bike should start to roll forward slowly. If you feel confident apply a little throttle until you are at a comfortable speed and raise your right foot when necessary.</li>
                                <li>Now you are riding! Your shift pattern will always be,if standard gearing is setup, down one up the rest. For example if you have 6 gears and start at neutral the pattern would be down-up-up-up-up-up.</li>
                            <ul><li>You will have to slip your toe under the shifter to shift up.</li></ul>
                            </ol>
                                <ul><li><b>Tips</b></li>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Dirt is the best surface to ride on. Sand and pavement have very little traction which will make riding difficult.</li><br>
                                        <li>It is best to ride in the desert or a large clearing in a forest to get used to how your bike reacts.</li><br>
                                        <li>If you are forced to ride through sand or other fine loose terrain, go faster than you believe you should. If you go too slow you will allow yourself to lose balance and fall. Going faster will stabilize you. If you go too fast however, you run the risk of your back tire sliding back and forth.</li><br>
                                        <li>Try to lean forward a slight bit if you are riding a 2-stroke with a lot of power to the back wheel. It is very easy to lean back to far and start an unexpected wheelie.</li>
